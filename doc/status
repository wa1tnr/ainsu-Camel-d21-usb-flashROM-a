Definitely now dumping SPI flashROM to the terminal
(forth never gets to run, in this version; it's all
preamble, before forth itself is called to begin).


Just populate the flashROM using the usual methods
(I use CircuitPython .UF2 to get going, then copy a
file onto the SPI flashROM, which presents to the
host PC as a mounted disk volume, as usual).

Test file was 500 kb of text:

     $ cat -n ./LICENSE >> catchfile.txt

..iterated many times.


Can be anything.


The program has an offset value to skip over the file
allocation table (very sloppy estimate; the program
jumps well into the first textfile when it begins).

Program presently gives a best effort at a (slightly)
modified CamelForth, with the latest developments, for
the SAMD21 (ATSAMD21G18A, Adafruit Feather M0 Express)
with limited SPI flashROM support (entirely untested
in a meaningful way - seems good according to what
Atmel Start generated for flashROM support, though).

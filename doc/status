  Other than code-cleanup chores, does not look like
  many changes are required from here, forward - the
  DUMPFL word is pretty much the DUMP word, but
  applied to a different 'memory space' (external
  SPI flashROM, in this instance).

  Good outcome.  Useful tool.

  Working SPI flashROM dump word.  Works just the
  same as the regular dump word (which at the moment
  is disabled; need to reinstate).

  This is a very nice thing to have available. ;)

  Just populate the SPI flashROM with ascii text
  files(s) (source code or any other plaintext
  document).  Or even binaries.

  The dump word will handle it. ;)

Definitely now dumping SPI flashROM to the terminal
(forth never gets to run, in this version; it's all
preamble, before forth itself is called to begin).


Just populate the flashROM using the usual methods
(I use CircuitPython .UF2 to get going, then copy a
file onto the SPI flashROM, which presents to the
host PC as a mounted disk volume, as usual).

Test file was 500 kb of text:

     $ cat -n ./LICENSE >> catchfile.txt

..iterated many times.


Can be anything.


The program has an offset value to skip over the file
allocation table (very sloppy estimate; the program
jumps well into the first textfile when it begins).

Program presently gives a best effort at a (slightly)
modified CamelForth, with the latest developments, for
the SAMD21 (ATSAMD21G18A, Adafruit Feather M0 Express)
with limited SPI flashROM support (entirely untested
in a meaningful way - seems good according to what
Atmel Start generated for flashROM support, though).

  On branch lark-ad-cont-

Program presently gives a best effort at a (slightly)
modified CamelForth, with the latest developments, for
the SAMD21 (ATSAMD21G18A, Adafruit Feather M0 Express)
with limited SPI flashROM support (entirely untested
in a meaningful way - seems good according to what
Atmel Start generated for flashROM support, though).
